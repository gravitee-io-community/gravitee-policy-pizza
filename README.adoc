== Description

You can use the `pizza` policy to create a pizza from request or response headers and/or body.

This policy allows the API Publisher to configure:

 * The `crust`, which can be any string
 * The `sauce`, which can only be `TOMATO` or `CREAM`
 * If he allows the API Consumer to add `pineapple` topping on its pizza.

Then, the consumer of the API has to provide toppings to build the pizza.
It can be done by providing one of the following or both:

 * `X-Pizza-Topping` header with as many value as he wants
 * An array of strings as a json payload. Providing an invalid payload will result on a `400 - BAD_REQUEST` or `500 - Internal Server Error`

If no toppings are provided, the policy does nothing expect adding the `X-Pizza: not-created` header.
Else, a pizza object will be created and set as payload, and the header `X-Pizza: created will be added`.

If `pineapple` is forbidden, and the API COnsumer tries to use it as a topping, then it should result in

 * A `406 - Not Acceptable` on the request phase
 * A `500 - Internal Server Error` on the response phase


== Configuration

You can configure the policy with the following options:
